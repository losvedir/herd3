# HERD3

The Haskell, Elasticsearch, React.js, D3 playground. The goal is to create
an analytics dashboard of D3/react.js components displaying elasticsearch
facets of our coaches, messages, etc, all served from a lightning-fast, typesafe
scotty webserver.

    Download the clang wrapper from [1] below
    $ mv ~/Downloads/clang-xcode5-wrapper /usr/local/bin/
    $ chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/clang-xcode5-wrapper
    Edit the GHC settings, per [1].

    $ cd path/to/herd3
    $ cabal sandbox init
    $ cabal install --only-dependencies
    $ cabal build
    $ dist/build/herd3/herd3

Styles are written in sass in herd3/assets/styles/*. Compile (and optionally --watch)
them with sass into /static/css/*, which is statically served by the middleware:

    herd3 $ sass --watch herd3/assets/styles:herd3/static/css/
